      <h1>Adventure</h1>
      <p>
      Adventure is a fuel to living. It adds up the spice I need to live my life to the fullest. I love to trek to the
      himalayan region of Nepal to experience adventure and beauty of nature. I hope someday I can play my part to
      make this region a popular destination of natural beauty and adventure.

        I have been to some of the northern parts of Nepal. It is full of adventurous places. It is absolutely mind blowing.
        I am sure you will enjoy these places. I have been to <span class="Emphasis">Annapurna Base Camp trek, Tilicho Lake trek, Rara lake and
        Ghale Ghau</span>. I have done rafting and paragliding, and next one would be bungie. I am planning to go to <span class="Highlighter">Everest Base Camp soon.</span>

      Health is wealth. Sport makes my heart pound and helps me realize that I am still alive. I have always
      enjoyed playing sports since my childhood. It is my other half of life. It helps me become social
      and learn people skill. Cricket, football, basketball, valleyball, badminton, tennis, bicycling, running
      are some of the sports I love.

      It is one of the special ingredient which makes me feel this life as a gift of nature. My eldest
      brother inspired me to listen to various kinds of music. Whenever I feel low, I listen to music. It keeps
      me alive and happy. I love all kinds of music. Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Queen, Pink Floyd,
      Nepathya, The Edge Band, Mantra, Bipul Chettri, Kali Prasad Baskota are some of my favorite musicians.
