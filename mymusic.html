      <h1>Music</h1>
      <p class="FirstParagraph">
        It is one of the special ingredient which makes me feel this life as a gift of nature. My eldest
        brother inspired me to listen to various kinds of music. Whenever I feel low, I listen to music. It keeps
        me alive and happy. I love all kinds of music. Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Queen, Pink Floyd,
        Nepathya, The Edge Band, Mantra, Bipul Chettri, Kali Prasad Baskota are some of my favorite musicians.

        Music is here since the beginning of time. There are music related to every community around the
        world. Traditional music is the heart of all the music. Music is changing everyday. There are various
        kinds of music popular now a days. I love most of them.

        I play guitar to learn music. I like to play Nepali, English and Hindi songs in my guitar.
        Beatles, CCR, Mohammed Rafi, Narayan Gopal, Arun Thapa are some of the musicians whose songs feel
        fulfilling to sing and play. I have also taken a music class in my associate's degree. There I
        got to learn some music theories. I have also bought mike to be able to sing karoake sometimes.

      Adventure is a fuel to living. It adds up the spice I need to live my life to the fullest. I love to trek to the
      himalayan region of Nepal to experience adventure and beauty of nature. I hope someday I can play my part to
      make this region a popular destination of natural beauty and adventure.

      Health is wealth. Sport makes my heart pound and helps me realize that I am still alive. I have always
      enjoyed playing sports since my childhood. It is my other half of life. It helps me become social
      and learn people skill. Cricket, football, basketball, valleyball, badminton, tennis, bicycling, running
      are some of the sports I love.
