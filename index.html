      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p class="FirstParagraph">
        My name is Sujit Neupane. I am from Imadol, Lalitpur, Nepal. Currently, I
        live in Seattle, WA, USA. I have earned Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from University of
        Washington. I have lived in UK for 3 years and my favourite city to visit in UK is
        Edinburgh. I also love to trek to the <span class="Emphasis">Himalayan region of Nepal.</span> It is
        very beautiful. It feels fulfilling to go there and enjoy the scenery.
      </p>
      <h2>My Goal</h2>
      <p>
      Make this world a beautiful place and save it for our upcoming generations. My favorite
      quotation is <span class="Highlighter">Think Good, Be Good and Do Good.</span> I want to
      devote my life to <span class="Emphasis">The Mother Earth</span> from where I want to 
      eradicate war and violence and establish a meaningful peaceful life experience for everyone.

      Adventure is a fuel to living. It adds up the spice I need to live my life to the fullest. I love to trek to the
      himalayan region of Nepal to experience adventure and beauty of nature. I hope someday I can play my part to
      make this region a popular destination for natural beauty and adventure.

      Health is wealth. Sport makes my heart pound and helps me realize that I am still alive. I have always
      enjoyed playing sports since my childhood. It is my other half of life. It helps me become social
      and learn people skill. Cricket, football, basketball, valleyball, badminton, tennis, bicycling, running
      are some of the sports I love.

      It is one of the special ingredient which makes me feel this life as a gift of nature. My eldest
      brother inspired me to listen to various kinds of music. Whenever I feel low, I listen to music. It keeps
      me alive and happy. I love all kinds of music. Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Queen, Pink Floyd,
      Nepathya, The Edge Band, Mantra, Bipul Chettri, Kali Prasad Baskota are some of my favorites.
